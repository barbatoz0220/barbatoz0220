# Hey there! 👋
### About me 😎
My name is Phạm Hoàng Nam Anh, and I'm:
- A sloppy coder on his own journey to rule out the 'sloppiness' in my code.
- A foodie with 'burning' passion for learning new recipes (see what i did there? 👀)
- A day-dreamer

### What I am trying to do right now ⏲️
- I have successfully joined the family of KMS-Labs and doing my best to make the most out of my time here
- Learning old and new things
- Trying to finish my Goodread's Reading Challenge

### What I would like to do for tomorrow 📓
- I don't really know, I'll probably procrastinate for a majority of the time and feel depressed about it later in the night
- or I can be super duper productive and sit in front of my laptop to code for hours
- or I will just pull out all the stuff I've been wanting to do and actually do them

## Whatever it is I will be wasting most of the time anyway.. but that shouldn't stop me from nailing things I can still accomplish, right? 🌃
