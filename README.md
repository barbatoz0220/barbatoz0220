# Hey there! :rocket:
## My name is Pham Hoang Nam Anh,
I'm a sloppy coder with no definitive life goals yet.
I've been failing for so many times I cannot count, and yet I'm still here, still aspire to become as good at coding as I can ever imagine.
There are so many things going on around me that I cannot figure out at once.
So many things to do within so little time.
But that shouldn't stop me from nailing things I can accomplish today, right?
