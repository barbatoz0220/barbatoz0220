# Hey there! :rocket:
## This is Nam Anh writing,
### About me üòÖ
- I'm a sloppy coder with no definitive life goals so far.
- I've been failing for so many times I cannot count, and yet I'm still here, still aspire to become as good at coding as I can ever imagine.
- I don't know why either, LOL

### What I am trying to do right now ‚è≤Ô∏è
- There are so many things going on around me that I cannot figure out at once.
So many things to do within so little time: 
  - Learning web technologies and work in a full-stack position
  - Learning mobile app development to build things that would stop me from looking at my phone 24/7
  - Learning Data Science, Deep Learning and Machine Learning to create models that do wonders
  and the list goes on...

### What I would like to do for tomorrow üìì
- I don't really know, I'll probably procrastinate for a majority of the time and feel depressed about it later in the night
- or I can be super duper productive and sit in front of my laptop to code for hours
- or I will just pull out all the stuff I've been wanting to do and actually do them

## Whatever it is I will be wasting most of the time anyway.. but that shouldn't stop me from nailing things I can still accomplish, right? üåÉ
